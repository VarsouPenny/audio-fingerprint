## Overview
In this project we use [devaju](https://willdrevo.com/fingerprinting-and-audio-recognition-with-python/) which is an audio fingerprinting and recognition algorithm implemented in Python.
Dejavu can memorize audio by listening to it once and fingerprinting it. Then by playing a song and recording microphone input or reading from disk, Dejavu attempts to match the audio against the fingerprints held in the database, returning the song being played.
